#
# Minimal weight primitive polynomials over GF(2)
# with leading term between 10000 and 30000.
# These are the values of n, between 10000 and 30000,
# for which the factorization of 2^n-1 is known to me.
# In addition the coefficients/bits (apart from the
# constant and the leading term) are as small as possible.
